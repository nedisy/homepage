Barn door star tracker is a concept to make star tracker out of scrap materials. One of the crucial component is the barn door hinge. Using basic components like woods and screws, star tracker hinge can be made to a very accurate degree. However, the problem of accurate but slow moving motor is still present in this DIY approach. Using gears and extremely long screw that has been demonstrated by the Youtube Channel Alpha Phoenix in theory, do work very well. It remans to be calculated how effective it is compared to just buying star tracker, given there are many new cheap options available today.
