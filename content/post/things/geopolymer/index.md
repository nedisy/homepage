# Geopolymer
## Intro
It's a fascinating polymer consisted of inorganic monomers that is fire resistant, heat resistant, acid and base resistant, yet as strong as regular portland cement. It has way less water and pores than the portland cement, just because geopolymer is made by polymerization, not hydration. It consumes far less $\operatorname{CO_2}$. It is maintained by the [geopolymer institute](https://www.geopolymer.org).

It has the potential to compete or even replace the traditional portland cement.

## Precursor
There are a numberof precursors available to synthesize geopolymer. The main factor determining the success of geopolymerization is the dissolution rate and mineral type.

For clays, there are 3 main categories of them:
1. Kaolinite
2. Illite
3. Smectite

The most ideal precursor is the kaolinite. One way to test if a clay is kaolinite or not is to measure it's density, if it's around 2.7, most likely it is a kaolin clay.

## Result
Use of kaolinite proven to be most reliable. Two mix was made using kaolinite from weathered andesite site in Gondang, Bojonegoro and sediment of weathered volcaniclast, pumice, and volcanic ash in Beji, Depok. Size of grains matter a lot. first batch from Gondang was not sieved and it result in moderate strength geopolymer. Metakaolin sieved with no. 300 sieve proven to be highly reactive, good consistency and strong final product.

Below is my personal trial result. The black sample is the geopolymer made from Beji, Depok clay deposit. The orange one was made from Gondang, Bojonegoro. The other things are just failed trials using marl instead of kaolinite-rich deposit.
